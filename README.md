# Filtering Join

- Mutating versus filtering joins
1. Mutation Joins
Combine data from two tables based on matching observations in both tables

2. Filtering Joins
Filter observations from table based on whether or not they match an observation in another table

- What is a semi-join ?
1. Returns the intersection, similar to an inner join
2. Returns only columns from the left table and not the right
3. No duplicates

- What is an anti-join
1. Returns the left table, excluding the intersection
2. Returns only columns from the left table and not the right
