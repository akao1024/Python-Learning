# Functions

1. Functions
- There are some functions we already or we already use, such as type(), str(), etc
- Functions are a piece of reusable code
- Solve particular task

2. Help! Function
- Maybe you already know the name of a Python function, but you still have to figure out how to use it. Ironically, you have to ask for information about a function with another function: help(). In IPython specifically, you can also use ? before the function name.
To get help on the max() function, for example, you can use one of these calls:
help(max)
?max
