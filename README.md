# Dictionaries

We used to store the data through list, but it's kind of inconvenient when we want to extract the corresponding data within it.
Therefore, now we have dictionaries to help us store the data, so we have a more convenient when we need to extract the data

- world = {"afghanistan":30.55, "albania":2.77, "algeria":39.21}
print(world["albania"]) ---> 2.77
