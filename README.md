# Pandas

import pandas as pd
brics = pd.read_csv("path/to/brics.csv", index_col = 0)
brics

- index & select data
1. Square Brackets
2. Advanced Methods
a. loc
b. iloc

we should know the difference when extract the data through one bracket or two brackets
1. brics["RU"] ---> Row as panda series
2. brics[["RU"]} ---> DataFrame

Will upload more photos for this part
